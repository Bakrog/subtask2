## Subtask2 Plugin Documentation

The following is the complete documentation for the subtask2 plugin. Study it carefully to understand all available features.

<subtask2-readme>
${README_PLACEHOLDER}
</subtask2-readme>

## Your Task

Using the subtask2 inline syntax documented above, create a workflow to fulfill the user's request.

### Output Format

1. Output your reasoning first - analyze what the user needs and how to best structure the workflow
2. Then output the workflow inside: <subtask2 auto="true">...</subtask2>
3. The workflow must be a single /subtask {...} command with inline syntax
4. Do NOT create files - the workflow executes in memory
5. Use returns to chain multiple steps
6. Use parallel for concurrent independent tasks
